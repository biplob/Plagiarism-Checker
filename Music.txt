Music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient Greece, in fact it was one of the main subjects taught to children. Musical education was considered to be important
 for the development of an individual's soul. Musicians and singers played a prominent role in Greek theater[24] and the ones who received a musical education were seen as nobles and in 
perfect harmony (as can be read in the Republic, Plato) Mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies.[25] Holy Ancient Greek music is considered 
an example of perfection and purity. Instruments included the double-reed aulos and a plucked string instrument, the lyre, principally the special kind called a kithara. Music was an important 
part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six. Greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development. Greek music theory included the Greek musical modes, that 
eventually became the basis for Western religious and classical music. Later, influences from the Roman Empire, Eastern Europe, and the Byzantine Empire changed Greek music. The Seikilos epitaph
 is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world.[26] The oldest surviving work written on the subject of music theory 
is Harmonika Stoicheia by Aristoxenus.[27]
